        How to respond to common billing scenarios PRIMARY RESPOND : “ We truly
        appreciate your call and for letting us know that you experience with
        you bill has not been up to par. I know your services are important to
        you . Im an expert and can certainly help you with your concern. So ,
        allow me to do some visual audit on your billing statement for us to
        figure out about the bill increase and to see what could have causing
        this. May I put this call on hold to check on the account then I’ll get
        back to you.
        __________________________________________________________________________
        RECOMMENDED RECAP AND CLOSE: I'd like to make sure you are aware that
        you currently have a bundled package with cable-internet and phone
        service along with discounts. Please be assured that you have the best
        deal at the moment and we are also coming up with updated promotions for
        the coming holidays. You will definitely know if we will have another
        set of promotions and while waiting , I'd like to take this opportunity
        to inform you that you are eligible to join Xfinity Rewards. Xfinity
        REWARDS is a customer appreciation program, where ENROLLMENT is free and
        REDEMPTION is easy. ——— SCENARIO : Bill increase (Promo Roll Off) ———
        HOW MIGHT IT SOUND : Thank you for patiently waiting on the line
        Mr.Customer . Upon checking on the account , the bill is higher this
        month after the promotional discount provided to you 12 months ago has
        ended. What this means that for the last 12 months , you’re on a package
        of service where you’ve been enjoying ( 20$ per month amount of savings
        because of that promotion) . —— SCENARIO : Bill increase (OTC ,Tech fee
        or late fee ) —— HOW MIGHT IT SOUND : Thank you for patiently waiting on
        the line Mr.Customer . The bill was higher this month as a result of ;
        Now that the promotion discount is over , your monthly bill will be back
        to it’s regular rate and that’s for the amount of $$$ and that’s what
        the amount showing on your bill right now. - I should add that you are
        under one of the best packages we have. So you’re actually getting a
        good deal here. - Movies rented on _____ - The technician visit on
        _______ - Temporary pause on your services on ______ - A late fee for
        Your Xfinity payment is due by the date noted at the top of your bill.
        If you haven't made a payment by this due date, a charged for a late fee
        will show up on your next bill and that’s the cause of the increase for
        this months bill. But this should not be cause for alarm. As a one time
        charge , it is just that. Should you not make any changes on your
        account then your bill will remain at the monthly recurring charge of
        $$. ——————- SCENARIO : Lower my bill ——————— HOW MIGHT IT SOUND : As i
        will check the account here Mr. Customer . - Can you tell me what about
        your package you would like to keep and what your okay with not having ?
        That will allow me to look up a bundle or something similar while making
        sure you keep what matters to you. since we have bundles and packages
        that fit a variety of your needs . And it’s just a matter of knowing
        what you use your services the most on so you keep what’s valuable to
        you. Your internet services , for example , can you describe to me what
        you usually use for it?

        Alex upon checking her ansd as i did some visual audit about the details
        of the services. It shows and i hope that you are aware that actually
        you are getting thsi loyalty discount on a month to month basis. If we
        do change of service. Im afraid that it will eliminate this discount and
        the bill will be higher instead of lowering it down. And also the
        package that youa re right now is actually the best paclkage specially
        it is the highest tier level of service both internet and TV .
